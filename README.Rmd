Agmet is a collection of functions to calculate solar position, reference evapotranspiration, and soil water balance.

The following document describes the procedures to install Agmet directly from GitHub as well as some of the functionalities embedded in this package.

## Package's installation

To install Agmet in your computer with R already installed do the following

```{r}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/jvitorpinto/agmet.git')
```

## Using Agmet

```{r include=FALSE}
require(agmet)
```

The function `stefan_boltzmann_law` calculates the amount of radiation emitted by a black body as a function of its absolute temperature.

```{r}
temp <- seq(273.15, 473.15, by = 0.1)
y <- stefan_boltzmann_law(temp)

plot(temp, y, type = 'l', xlab = expression(italic(T) ~ ('K')), ylab = expression('Black body emittance' ~ (W ~ m^-2)))
```
